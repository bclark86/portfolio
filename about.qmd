I have an insatiable curiosity and appetite for learning. I love solving problems that involve blending an understanding of people and process with quantitative data analysis. 

#### BACKGROUND
I'm experienced in generating value with data / data science (segmentation, analytics, modeling, experimentation, machine learning) for real estate, subscription / e-commerce, product development, monetization, acquisition, growth, and CRM teams within retail (Petco; H&M) and B2C SaaS companies (Dashlane; Noom).

I have two master's degrees:

1. MBA in Strategy / Tech Product Management from NYU Stern (2022)
2. MS in Applied Business Analytics from Boston University (2018)

#### STRENGTHS
Pattern Recognition. Data-Driven Decision-Making. Synthesis. Resourcefulness. Adaptability.

2. Learner: great desire to learn and continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites me.
